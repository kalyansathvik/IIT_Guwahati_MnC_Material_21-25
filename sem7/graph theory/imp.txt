Prof: K V Krishna
->Open elective so less competition
->he will ask questions from Bondy and Douglas only(and some very easy questions). Don't waste time trying those problems, just search them in stackexchange if you don't get them. In exam, he will give so many questions that it is not possible to think then and there itself.
->Don't need to remember proofs that he teaches in class( he asked only 6 marks overall afair)
