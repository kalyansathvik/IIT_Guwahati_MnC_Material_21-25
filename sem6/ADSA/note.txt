Just read everything that he has taught
He doesn't teach few things clearly(I think wantedly) like KMP algorithm, convex hull merge, convex hull intersection and asks them in the exams for sure
Attending classes help(or have a friend who attends classes)


Bin packing:

Merging convex hulls:

no proper resource for intersection:
