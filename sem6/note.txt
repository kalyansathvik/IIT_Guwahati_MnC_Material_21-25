TOC: Sagarmoy Dutta:
He doesn't teach theory well(upar upar se kar tha h) but do attend his problem discussion classes.
Paper correction is chill but if you go to ask for marks and you are wrong, he will shout on you.
Has given 4 grade to ~30 people in my seniors batch.

SIMA:Arabin:
Mug up the notes(you don't even need to know the meaning).
Postmidsem he became a little naughty and didn't post a few notes but asked that in the exam.

Finance:Chandan Pal:
Reasonable prof.Do the assignments for pre-midsem and solve shreve questions if they are in the theory covered.
Post-midsem has a lot of theory and proofs to remember...he asked 2/3 questions on that.

Finance lab:Chandan Pal:
Apart from seeing lab codes, do read theory that's happening in the classes

Scientific Computing:Natesan:
Took attendance so had to attend the class but very difficult to understand what he is saying.
Try to find out the book from which he is saying for that topic and read from that.

ADSA:G K Das:
Attend his classes and read everything that he says(including the ones that he doesn't teach clearly). Easy course apart from the competition from friends.
